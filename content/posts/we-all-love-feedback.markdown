We hope you all found Utopia to be an enjoyable and thought-provoking experience. We wanted to engage you with interesting discussions, empower you to create a more inclusive Civil Service, and leave you with inspiration for new ways of working. We hope we have achieved at least a small part of our ambition.

Most importantly, we hope you had fun and met some great people!

Thank you to all those scanning our CR codes throughout the day to leave feedback on individual sessions. We would be very grateful if you would also take two minutes to fill out our Post-Conference Feedback Form by following this [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccM0KoEWoU3h5gQ9sGzprv1zuGsbi0qD-jzyC1S2-mOVShEQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

This will help us to fulfill our legacy commitments by taking on board your comments and suggestions to make next yearâ€™s conference even better than this years.

Many thanks in advance!
