  Session Content


  This seminar takes a look at the role of line and team managers in respect of
  Diversity and Inclusion. 


  Successful, inclusive teams aspire to high productivity, high performance,
  high quality, and great time and cost efficiency in all they do. But what does
  Inclusion actually mean when it comes to managing and creating the culture of
  your first team? Is there a danger that an over adherence to equalities
  legislation and new trends in Inclusive management can inadvertently exclude
  as many as they include? What approach are you going to adopt when you create
  a new team or step up to manage an existing team given the many and varied
  benefits of having an inclusive team. In this session Helen will talk you
  through some of the real life challenges facing managers in the workplace as
  well as her ideas for the approach that modern leaders and forward thinkers
  can take – assuming, of course, that Inclusion is important to them.
