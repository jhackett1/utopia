description: "View From the Outside - Why Does Civil Service Diversity Matter?\n*Strand 2 Headline Discussion*\nModerator: Emma Green\nPanellists: Dr Naseer Siabi, Melanie Richards, Elliot Rae\n13:45-14:40\n120 Spaces\n\nSession Content\n\nIn the headline panel of the Future Workforce Strand, we invite respected D&I champions and leaders from outside the Civil Service to discuss D&I in government and how it affects wider society. This panel of award winning D&I champions and industry leaders will discuss why and how diversity in the Civil Service affects other sectors and national outcomes. What diversity and inclusion beyond protected characteristics really mean and how it needs to be cultivated to really drive great outcomes. \n\nThe panel will answer the question of why diversity in the central government is something that affects and matters to everyone, regardless of how they identify and why therefore it should matter to all of us. We hope delegates will take away inspiration on why and how they can champion D&I and how far reaching the outcomes of doing so can and will be. \n\nDr Naseer Siabi, Chief Executive Officer at Microlink PC\n\nDr Nasser Siabi has been frequently cited as a ‘visionary’ and natural born philanthropist.
