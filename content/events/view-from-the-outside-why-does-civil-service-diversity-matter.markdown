  In the headline panel of the Future Workforce Strand, we invite respected D&I
  champions and leaders from outside the Civil Service to discuss D&I in
  government and how it affects wider society. This panel of award winning D&I
  champions and industry leaders will discuss why and how diversity in the Civil
  Service affects other sectors and national outcomes. What diversity and
  inclusion beyond protected characteristics really mean and how it needs to be
  cultivated to really drive great outcomes. 


  The panel will answer the question of why diversity in the central government
  is something that affects and matters to everyone, regardless of how they
  identify and why therefore it should matter to all of us. We hope delegates
  will take away inspiration on why and how they can champion D&I and how far
  reaching the outcomes of doing so can and will be. 


  Biography - Dr Naseer Siabi, Chief Executive Officer. Microlink PC

  Dr Nasser Siabi has been frequently cited as a ‘visionary’ and natural born
  philanthropist. His background of computer science, technology, and advanced
  studies to PhD level coupled with a chronic visual impairment, lead him to
  develop a pioneering business model for Microlink.


  Microlink was established in 1992 and was co-founded with his business partner
  Vahid Ganjavian, who as an established entrepreneur with Dyslexia, faced
  similar boundaries within the workplace. The disability combination of these
  two individuals enabled the company to advance in the field of assistive
  technology and training, rapidly. Microlink with Dr Siabi and Mr Ganjavian at
  the helm has consistently improved the lives of over a quarter of a million
  disabled students and individuals over the last 20 years and has been
  established as an industry leader.


  Dr Nasser Siabi’s vision to improve the overall wellbeing of humanity,
  starting from education entry, to gaining employment and living lives that
  maximise their full potential, is pioneering work. Dr Nasser Siabi, who was
  awarded an OBE in 2011, his company and staff are dedicated to this cause and
  through consistent research, data capturing, impressive statistics and
  overwhelming proof that his ‘idea for an all inclusive society’ works across
  all levels.


  As a result Microlink and Dr Nasser Siabi consistently consults on Government
  policy, disability organisations and blue chip multi-national companies as the
  ‘go to’ organisation and experts within their field.


  Dr Naseer Siabi  is a member The Business Disability Forum (BDF), and the DWP
  Disability Employer engagement Steering Group. In 2015 he was awarded the
  Lifetime Achiever Award, National Diversity Awards and in the OBE for
