  Session content

  New technologies have the potential to radically transform the design,
  delivery and impact of public services. The effects on people and ways of
  working are set to be enormous. The Civil Service needs to keep pace with this
  unprecedented rate of change, and ensure that the benefits of new digital
  tools and emerging technologies are properly harnessed. This requires staff
  from across the spectrum – not just a narrow group of experts – to understand
  and engage with these new realities. At the same time, policymakers need to
  navigate any false hype and pseudo-capabilities to ensure that new technology
  actually delivers on Civil Service priorities, and is not seen as a catch-all
  panacea. In this session, delegates will hear from a leading expert about the
  future of technology within the Civil Service, and the challenges involved in
  navigating the changes ahead.
