  Biography

  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) provides advice and support for the
  public and private sector in how to avoid computer security threats. Its
  parent organisation is GCHQ. 

  Session content

  The UK faces a sustained threat from hostile state actors and cyber criminals.
  The NCSC defends the UK from over 10 attacks every week. Malicious cyber
  campaigns targeting intellectual property and sensitive commercial data are
  being carried out across the world.
   
  These online threats and technology-enabled hostile actions are relevant to
  Civil Servants from all areas â€“ not just those in specialist security
  positions or working on Secret material.


  In this breakout session, delegates will gain insight into a range of areas,
  from cyber warfare, emerging threats and the struggle for digital supremacy
  through to the challenges faced by those working to keep people and systems
  safe.
