  Session Content


  This session is an opportunity for you to be directly involved in the
  relationship between Fast Streamers and the Head of the Fast Stream. It will
  be an opportunity for delegates to hear directly from the top and engage with
  Greg in his role as the SRO for the Fast Stream but also as a former Fast
  Streamer himself. Get clarification on any rumours that you have heard
  circulating, find out straight from the source about future plans in this
  uncertain political context, and have your questions answered.
