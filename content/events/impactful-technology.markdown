  Session Content


  What does government impact look like, and what approaches and technologies
  can help us get there? In this session, experts from the Centre for Public
  Impact will cover three areas that are crucial for effective government
  services:


  - Legitimacy

  - Policy

  - Action


  Delegates will benefit from a wealth of material developed by leading
  practitioners and academics, and explore how the Civil Service can take
  advantage of new technologies. They will leave the session with a simple and
  actionable tool to take into their everyday work.
