  Session Content


  This session will focus on helping Fast Streamers leverage their Personal
  Power on your career journeys. It will be based on a framework Dumi uses for
  team development training called the Personal Power Mastery Programme, or
  PPMaP. This framework will help participants explore and gain a deeper
  understanding of the power dynamics at play in the workplace and to develop
  strategies for building and maintaining a positive relationship with self and
  others.


  The outcomes of the coaching sessions will centre around:

  - Gaining a clear sense of self: how to live a life of purpose and impact

  - Overcoming limiting beliefs 

  - Dealing with conflict  

  - Communicating your impact
