  With the increasing demands and pace of life in a rapidly changing world,
  stress remains a major drain on both personal and business resources. However,
  much can be done to build abilities and skills that generate personal
  wellbeing, leadership presence, emotional intelligence and a healthy working
  environment. In this talk, we start to unlock the concept of stress, explore
  its causes and discover some solutions.
