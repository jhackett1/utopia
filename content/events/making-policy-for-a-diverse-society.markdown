  Making Policy for a Diverse Society

  Speaker: Vivienne Aiyela

  11:45-12:40

  40 Spaces


  As our society becomes increasingly diverse, the Civil Service faces the
  challenge of creating policy that yields the best outcome in a complex
  landscape. Vivienne Aiyela, a visionary and D&I expert, will discuss how
  government can engage with the public and ensure that its policy development
  and implementation does not adversely affect any parts of our society.


  Delegates will come away with:


  1) Practical ways to shape inclusive policy that champions D&I from design
  through to implementation in a sustainable and responsible manner, that is
  responsive and sensitive to the complexities of modern society;


  2) A deeper understanding of the complexities that drive unintended exclusion
  and barriers to public services; and ideas of how to tackle them.
