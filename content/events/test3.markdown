  Background

  The Civil Service aims to be the UK’s most inclusive employer by 2020.
  Disabled colleagues tell us that a disability confident line manager is a key
  requirement in creating an inclusive culture, in which barriers are removed
  and talented disabled employees are able to reach their full potential. The
  Civil Service Disability Inclusion Team used the insights of disabled
  colleagues and line managers to develop and successfully pilot the ‘Being
  Disability Confident’ session at Civil Service Live 2018.


  What will I gain from attending the Being Disability Confident session?

  This interactive session will set out Civil Service Disability Champion Sir
  Philip Rutnam’s 6 key disability priorities, including the importance of the
  line manager’s role in creating a disability inclusive culture. This session
  is aimed at colleagues who want to explore the principles of disability
  confident line management and the key knowledge, skills and attributes
  required to support disabled employees. Participants will have the opportunity
  to apply their learning through a case study, be signposted to further
  resources and make a pledge to build disability confidence in their own team.
