  Wednesday 20th

  'The Social Mobility Experience', Jack Victor (Future Workforce)


  A session focussing on class and the importance of taking this invisible
  factor into account in our diversity and inclusion efforts. It will explore
  the benefits of doing so, and question the psychological and emotional effects
  on the socially mobile individual, and the challenges they may face. Group
  discussion will allow delegates to understand each other's lived experiences
  of this phenomenon, and how best to support colleagues in this situation.


  Thursday 21st

  'The Labour Productivity Problem', Ivan Srbulov (Future Workplace)


  This session will explore the two facets of the productivity problem: how work
  and productivity are changing, and how we need to change how we measure them.
  Delegates will be invited to consider the issues with applying traditional
  methods of measuring productivity to modern forms of work such as the gig
  economy or tech giants. From this foundation, delegates will discuss how this
  failure of traditional means to satisfactorily measure these outputs can have
  an impact on the evidence policy professionals rely on.
