  What will the future look like, and how can we shape it for the better? 


  Whilst current and future AI capabilities are often overstated, AI is already
  transforming a wide range of sectors, from transport, healthcare, finance, and
  security. These advances are raising deep questions about the implications for
  ethics and governance. How do we ensure AI systems will not embed unconscious
  biases in opaque decision-making processes, or entrench existing stereotypes
  by learning from datasets that reflect deep inequalities? What should be done
  about businesses seeking to use opaque yet biased algorithms to hide nefarious
  actions, or discriminatory hiring approaches? The challenges arising from the
  development of lethal autonomous weapons systems raise yet further questions.

  In this interactive panel session, delegates will explore these challenging
  issues and discuss what actions are needed to ensure future developments are
  ethical, safe and well-governed.


  Dr Melanie Smallman


  Dr Smallman’s research looks at how the public form views around new and
  emerging science and technology, the role of science and innovation in
  increasing economic inequality, how this is affecting perceptions of science
  and technology and what alternative innovation models are available.
