  HIPE


  HIPE helps civil servants have the biggest social impact they can. We can help
  you:

  - Identify roles and opportunities where you can have the biggest social
  impact, based on your own values.

  - Build your skills to ensure you do the most good possible, and are ready
  when the big opportunities come knocking. 

  - Connect with inspiring, like-minded and motivated civil servants.
