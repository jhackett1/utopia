  One of the Civil Service’s three objectives is to be the most inclusive
  employer by 2020. With 2020 now just a year away,  our Panel of Senior Civil
  Servants (SCS) who act as champions of D&I  across the Civil Service will
  discuss some of the practicalities  of achieving this goal. They will address
  why D&I is important to them and the Civil Service in general; how far we have
  come towards  achieving our 2020 goal and what we have left to do. The panel
  will include the Permanent Secretaries for MoJ and DfT,  the Chair of the
  Network and Former Chair of  a:gender. They will discuss what initiative the
  civil service has and need to reach its goals, but also some of the ways we
  can all contribute to D&I and why Civil Service Diversity and being an
  inclusive employer is all of our responsibilities. 


  Biography - Sir Richard Heaton, Permanent Secretary MOJ 

  Richard has been the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Justice since
  September 2015 and is also the Civil Service Race Champion. Prior to this he
  was the Permanent Secretary for the Cabinet Office and First Parliamentary
  Counsel. He has worked in legal and non-legal roles across government,
  focussing particularly on criminal law, the constitution and human rights law.
  He joined the civil service as a legal adviser at the Home Office in 1991. 


  Richard is also chair of a charity in South London.


  Biography - Bernadette Kelly, Permanent Secretary DfT

  Bernadette Kelly became Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport on
  18 April 2017.

  From September 2015 to April 2017, Bernadette Kelly was Director General, Rail
  Group in DfT. Prior to that she was a Director General at the Department for
  Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) from April 2010.

  Bernadette joined the Civil Service after graduating. She has spent most of
  her career working on public policy in relation to business and the economy.
  She has led work in government to reform the planning regime for major
  infrastructure; boost housing supply; establish the Competition and Markets
  Authority; strengthen utility regulation; reform corporate governance; and on
  industrial strategy and local growth and devolution. In addition to DfT and
  BIS, Bernadette has worked in the Department for Communities and Local
  Government, HM Treasury, the Cabinet Office and the Prime Minister’s Policy
  Unit; as well as on secondment to ICI plc.


  Bernadette was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 2010.


  Biography - Jacqui Gavin, Culture & Inclusion Manager, Cabinet Office 

  Jacqui joined the Civil Service in July 2009 where she joined the Department
  for Work & Pensions working out of Warrington Pension Centre after a long term
  career working her way up the career ladder in the private sector to head of
  Service Delivery for a major plc.


  It was a decision that Jacqui has not looked back on as she was able to
  combine her role as a respected transgender activist and directly working in
  the area of transgender equality at the heart of government. First of all as
  the first ever Chair of the Transgender Network within DWP followed by
  becoming a active Steering Group member of a:gender in 2010.


  This was the launchpad needed as she became the the Vice Chair of a:gender in
  2012 and in 2013 she became the youngest ever Chair and in March 2015 returned
  as the Vice Chair. This opportunity has allowed Jacqui to not only support the
  Civil Service in its delivery of transgender equality but to work with
  external organisations and entities to promote transgender equality across a
  wider landscape. This has highlighted to government the challenges of
  transgender people both within and outside of the Civil Service in their daily
  working lives. This has enabled the gap between government and private
  industry to be narrowed for equality in the workplace.


  Her dedication both within government and has been recognised nationally after
  she was ‘Highly Commended’ in class at the 2015 Excellence in Diversity Awards
  and was listed as the 44th most influential LGBTI person in the UK at the
  Independent on Sunday Rainbow List.

  marking, a priority for the then, Home Office Permanent Secretary, Mark
  Sedwill. He designed and delivered talent development programme for BAME staff
  in partnership with the Home Office, Diversity and Talent teams, which won the
