  Are you an ambitious rising star? Keen to make an impact at the heart of
  government? Coming to the attention of hostile foreign intelligence services?


  Civil Service Fast Streamers are attractive targets. The potential impact of
  successful state-sponsored espionage against the UK is both wide reaching and
  significant. The threat of spying did not end with the collapse of Soviet
  communism in the early 1990s. Espionage against UK interests still continues
  and is potentially very damaging. A number of foreign intelligence services
  seek to gather intelligence on a broad range of subjects, including foreign
  policy, defence, financial, technological, industrial and commercial
  interests.


  In this session led by experts from the Centre for the Protection of National
  Infrastructure (CPNI), Fast Streamers will explore the activities of foreign
  states targeting the UK, develop an understanding of their operating methods,
  and learn how to keep people, assets and information safe. 


  CPNI


  The Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure is the UK government
  authority which provides protective security advice to government, businesses
  and organisations across the national infrastructure. Its parent agency is
  MI5.
