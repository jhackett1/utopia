  Lord Wei


  The Rt Hon Lord Wei of Shoreditch is a peer with a background in business,
  investing, and technology. His interest in helping to start up and think about
  social enterprise led him to policy development and eventually being invited
  in mid-2009 to enter the House of Lords.  He holds a number of external
  commercial advisory and non-executive roles and runs a social enterprise,
  Shoreditch Ventures. He has three areas of focus in his public work: social
  reform, East Asia, and future cities.
