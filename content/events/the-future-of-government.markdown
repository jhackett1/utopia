  Session content

  Improving the use of digital is a core part of government’s strategy for
  improving services and delivering value for money. Making a success of digital
  transformation, and navigating the substantial risks inherent in such
  projects, remains a challenge for all. In this session, the IfG will discuss
  insights from its research into government effectiveness and technological
  transformation, and explore options for improving policymaking and service
  delivery.
