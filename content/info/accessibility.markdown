We want Utopia to be enjoyed by everyone. County Hall is a fully accessible venue. If you have any particular accessibility requirements on the day, please contact Ali White (alexandra.white@faststream.civilservice.gov.uk).

The entrance to the building has 5 shallow steps with a rail, and a stair life is available. Utopia will take place on the 3rd floor of County Hall, reached by lift and equipped with accessible toilets. There will be a quiet room available. County Hall welcomes guide dogs and can provide hearing/induction loops if notified of the requirement.
