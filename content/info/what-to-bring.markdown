order: 3

Your cross-Government pass. If you do not have one, please make us aware at least a week before Utopia (so that we can inform the venue) and bring ID.

A lanyard. Utopia is a "bring-your-own-lanyard" conference.

Your charged-up smartphone, so that you can log in here on the day to peruse the agenda and ask the team questions via live chat (using the icon in the bottom right corner of your screen).

A notepad and pen to take down ideas and contacts.

Any medication that you require.

An open mind and a positive attitude!
