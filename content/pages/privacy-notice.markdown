The _Utopia digital experience_ is built and maintained by fast streamers. We are not affiliated with the Government Digital Service.

We will collect and process some of your personal data in order to deliver the service.

## Data we use

We will use Google Analytics to collect anonymised data about how you use the _Utopia digital experience_, including:

* Your IP address
* The browser you use

Our chat service, Intercom, will collect similar data about you, including your email address if you choose to give it during a chat. You can see [their privacy policy here](https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy).

If you register for a Utopia ticket, our partner Eventbrite will also collect personal information about you. You can see [their privacy policy here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/support/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/eventbrite-privacy-policy?lg=en_GB).

Before the conference, we will copy a list of email addresses from Eventbrite into the _Utopia digital experience_.

## Why we need it

We will use your email address to control access to parts of the experience that are only intended for registered attendees, such as video livestreams and the full schedule.

We use Google Analytics to gauge interest in the content we publish and to make sure the _Utopia digital experience_ is meeting the needs of its users.
