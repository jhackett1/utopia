The Utopia digital experience is built and maintained by fast streamers. We are not affiliated with the Government Digital Service.

We will collect and process some of your personal data in order to deliver the service.

## Data we use

If you register for a Utopia ticket, our partner Eventbrite will collect personal information about you. You can see [their privacy policy here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/support/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/eventbrite-privacy-policy?lg=en_GB).

Before the conference, we will copy a list of email addresses from Eventbrite into the Utopia digital experience.

We will also use Google Analytics to collect anonymised data about how you use the Utopia digital experience, including:

* Your IP address
* The browser you use

## Why we need it

We will use your email address to control access to parts of the experience that are only intended for registered attendees, such as video livestreams and the full schedule.

We use Google Analytics to gauge interest in the content we publish and to make sure the Utopia digital experience is meeting the needs of its users.

## What we do with your data

The data we collect may be shared with other government departments or public bodies.

We will not: 

* Sell or rent your data to third parties
* Share your data with third parties for marketing purposes

## How long we keep your data

We will retain your data for up to several months after Utopia, in order to evaluate the success of the event.

## Your rights

You have the right to request:

* Information about how your personal data is processed
* A copy of that personal data

**If you have any of these requests or need more information, contact the Utopia team.**
